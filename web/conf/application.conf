# Performance-tuning: how many Documents to query per SELECT.
# Even though PostgreSQL and Akka _could_ stream all the documents from a single
# SELECT call, we don't want that: the SELECT would take a very long time before
# any results came through. Instead, we find the list of document IDs to query
# and then we SELECT just the first few documents in that list. Presto: a fast
# response time.
#
# Tuners beware: Documents can be beefy. Multiply this number with (2 *
# max_n_chars_per_document + [TODO: something like max_n_bytes_metadata_per_document])
# * (n concurrent requests you expect to serve) -- that's how much memory the
# web process can consume.
