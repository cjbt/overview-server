  This file was committed to git and then added to .gitignore. You should only
  see it if you have never run integration tests.

  If you run integration tests, they will overwrite this file. So if Jenkins
  sees this file after running integration tests, we know the integration tests
  never ran.

  Since we run integration tests in Docker, you'll want to mount this file as a
  volume in order to overwrite it.
